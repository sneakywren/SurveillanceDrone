# Surveillance Drone Project

## Overview
The **Surveillance Drone Project** is an advanced engineering initiative combining **embedded systems, robotics, and wireless communication**. The drone is designed for aerial monitoring and real-time data transmission using onboard sensors and computer vision systems.

## Features
- **Pixhawk 6C flight controller** for reliable stabilization and navigation  
- **Raspberry Pi 4** for onboard processing and AI-based vision tasks  
- **Wi-Fi module** for data transmission and remote control  
- **Modular power distribution** using appropriate AWG wiring and BECs  
- **Sensor suite** for temperature, CO/CO₂, and environmental monitoring  

## Components
- Frame: Custom-built quadcopter frame  
- Controller: Pixhawk 6C  
- Companion Computer: Raspberry Pi 4  
- Power: 4S LiPo battery with regulated BEC outputs  
- Communication: Wi-Fi broadcast  
- Sensors: M9N GPS + IST8310 compass, gas and temperature sensors  

## Goals
- Achieve **autonomous flight** with GPS-based navigation  
- Enable **real-time video and data streaming**  
- Integrate AI-based object recognition in future phases  

## Setup
1. Flash ArduPilot or PX4 firmware to Pixhawk 6C  
2. Connect Raspberry Pi via UART or USB for MAVLink communication  
3. Power all components with correct AWG wires and BECs  
4. Calibrate ESCs, sensors, and GPS using QGroundControl  
5. Run companion scripts for telemetry and camera feed  

## Future Plans
- Implement obstacle avoidance with depth cameras  
- Design a custom PCB for clean power and data management  
- Integrate AR gameplay overlay
